      <h3 class="user">What is useful to add as a user comment?</h3>
      <p>Any information you wanted to know about a gene before you started working on it... but please do not duplicate automatically generated information, e.g. protein length, or the top BLAST hit. You can submit published and unpublished information. If using unpublished data, please make sure to indicate how you arrived to these conclusions.</p>
      <h3 class="user">Have too many user comments to submit?</h3>
      <p><b>No problem!</b> Download the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bulk-user-comments-form">bulk user comment form</a>, fill it out, and send it back to <b>help@fungidb.org</b><p>
